  /// The parity acceptance condition of an automaton is characterized by
  ///    - The priority kind of the acceptance (min or max).
  ///    - The parity style, i.e. parity of the sets seen infinitely often
  //       (odd or even).
  ///    - The number of acceptance sets.
  ///
  /// The output will be an equivalent automaton with the new parity acceptance.
  /// The automaton must have a parity acceptance. The number of acceptance sets
  /// may be increased by one. Every transition will belong to at most one
  /// acceptance set.
  ///
  /// The parity kind is defined only if the number of acceptance sets
  /// is strictly greater than 1. The parity_style is defined only if the number
  /// of acceptance sets is non-zero. Some values of kind and style may result
  /// in equivalent outputs if the number of acceptance sets of the input
  /// automaton is not great enough.
