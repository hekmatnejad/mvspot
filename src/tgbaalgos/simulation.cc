// The way we will develop this algorithm is the following:
// We'll take an automaton, and reverse all these acceptance conditions.
// Then, to check if a transition i-dominates another, we'll use the bdd:
// sig(transA) = cond(trans) & acc(trans) & class(trans->state).
// Idem for sig(transB). Then, the transA dominates the transB if
// sig(transA) & sig(transB) == sig(transA).
// This work likely without the class, but with the class we need to
// include the relation. To achieve this goal, we'll use a bdd `rel',
// defined like this:
// `rel' is the conjunction of all the class implication. For example, if
// C(q1) => C(q2), and C(q2) => C(q3) in `rel', we'll see:
// rel = C(q1) => C(q2) & C(q2) => C(q3)
// We let the library do the simplification work if needed. This is
// useful in the domination computation:
// sig(transA) & sig(transB) & rel == sig(transA) & rel
// So the algorithm is cut into several step:
//
// 1. Running to the ba and switch the acceptance condition to their
//    negation, and initializing rel to bddtrue. This function is `init'.
// 2. Entering in the loop.
//    - running through the automaton and computing the signature of each
//      state. This function is `update_sig'.
//    - Entering in a double loop to adapt the partial order, and set
//      rel accordingly. This function is `update_po'.
// 3. Building an automaton with the result, with the condition:
// "a transition in the original automaton appears in the simulated one
// iff this transition is included in the set of i-maximal neighbour."
// This function is `build_output'.
//
// Obviously these functions are possibly cut into several little one.
// This is just the general development idea.
